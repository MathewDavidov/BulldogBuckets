What has your team accomplished in the past week? 

  We cleaned up code in various files, moved code to appropriate places, added password 
  hashing and salting, first and last name columns to be sent to datbase, fix navbar 
  routing and routing in general, and make it so if a registration is valid add user to database.
  Login and Logout integration with local database is added through flask library. 
  (other additions are listed in each commit summary).
  
Did your team encounter unexpected hurdles?

  Where to go from here on. Splitting work/what we should do.

How will your team work through any hurdle(s)? 

  We need to speak and work together and speak to other teams to understand the goals that
  need to be accomplished.
  
What tools worked, what didnâ€™t? 

  Flask login and logout works with local database.

Will there be any shifts or changes in the features your team will be working on? 

  Need actual integration with a database for everyone to use.

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 

  Same issues as last week.
