 This week the product team had finally finished all the designs and we forwarded all the designs
to front end. We intend to ask other teammates their opinion about what else we can possibly implement 
or fix up in terms of designs. If our teammates believe that there isn't really anything else we can
fix up or design we will start thinking about how we can advertise our project and how we can market 
our project.
