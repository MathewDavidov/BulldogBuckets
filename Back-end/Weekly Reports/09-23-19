What has your team accomplished in the past week? 

-We were deciding on a language for the backend, and we came to the conclusion to do it in 
python because it's a new experience. Additionally, we created a basic template for the 
website as a whole (in folders). This includes the app folder for python, static for css/js,
and templates for html files.

Did your team encounter unexpected hurdles?

-Where to even begin on the backend since most of us are relatively unexperienced in python.

How will your team work through any hurdle(s)? 

-We have a group chat designated to the group so we can discuss any issues we encounter.

What tools worked, what didnâ€™t? 

-We are mainly using VS code/sublime or any editor that works with git. 

Will there be any shifts or changes in the features your team will be working on? 

-This depends on the tasks given or expected from other teams such as the product team.

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 

-We need opinions on certain things. Integration with database is a must.
